      <title>A Web- and Mobile-Based Intervention for Comorbid, Recurrent Depression in Patients With Chronic Back Pain on Sick Leave (Get.Back): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial on Feasibility, User Satisfaction, and Effectiveness</title>
      <link>/en/publication/a-web-and-mobile-based-intervention-for-comorbid-recurrent-depression-in-patients-with-chronic-back-pain-on-sick-leave-get-back-pilot-randomized-controlled-trial-on-/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/en/publication/a-web-and-mobile-based-intervention-for-comorbid-recurrent-depression-in-patients-with-chronic-back-pain-on-sick-leave-get-back-pilot-randomized-controlled-trial-on-/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: Chronic back pain (CBP) is linked to a higher prevalence and higher occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and can lead to reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, individuals with both CBP and recurrent MDD are underidentified. Utilizing health care insurance data may provide a possibility to better identify this complex population. In addition, internet- and mobile-based interventions might enhance the availability of existing treatments and provide help to those highly burdened individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;: This pilot randomized controlled trial investigated the feasibility of recruitment via the health records of a German health insurance company. The study also examined user satisfaction and effectiveness of a 9-week cognitive behavioral therapy and Web- and mobile-based guided self-help intervention Get.Back in CBP patients with recurrent MDD on sick leave compared with a waitlist control condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: Health records from a German health insurance company were used to identify and recruit participants (N=76) via invitation letters. Study outcomes were measured using Web-based self-report assessments at baseline, posttreatment (9 weeks), and a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression); secondary outcomes included anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life), pain-related variables (Oswestry Disability Index, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and pain intensity), and negative effects (Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: The total enrollment rate with the recruitment strategy used was 1.26% (76/6000). Participants completed 4.8 modules (SD 2.6, range 0-7) of Get.Back. The overall user satisfaction was favorable (mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire score=24.5, SD 5.2). Covariance analyses showed a small but statistically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity in the intervention group (n=40) at posttreatment compared with the waitlist control group (n=36; F1,76=3.62, P=.03; d=0.28, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.74). Similar findings were noted for the reduction of anxiety symptoms (F1,76=10.45; P=.001; d=0.14, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.60) at posttreatment. Other secondary outcomes were nonsignificant (.06≤P≤.44). At the 6-month follow-up, the difference between the groups with regard to reduction in depressive symptom severity was no longer statistically significant (F1,76=1.50, P=.11; d=0.10, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.46). The between-group difference in anxiety at posttreatment was maintained to follow-up (F1,76=2.94, P=.04; d=0.38, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.83). There were no statistically significant differences across groups regarding other secondary outcomes at the 6-month follow-up (.08≤P≤.42).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;: These results suggest that participants with comorbid depression and CBP on sick leave may benefit from internet- and mobile-based interventions, as exemplified with the positive user satisfaction ratings. The recruitment strategy via health insurance letter invitations appeared feasible, but more research is needed to understand how response rates in untreated individuals with CBP and comorbid depression can be increased.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;projektbeschreibung&#34;&gt;Projektbeschreibung&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten wurden große Anstrengungen in die Entwicklung, Testung und Implementation von eHealth für eine weite Bandbreite von Gesundheitsproblemen, im körperlichen wie im psychischen Bereich gesetzt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nichtsdestotrotz schaffen es wenige Interventionen in die Routinebehandlung, oder benötigen viele Jahre auf dem Weg dahin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ImpleMentAll (IMA) zielt darauf ab, durch die Entwicklung, Anwendung und Evaluation maßgeschneiderter Implementationsstrategien in einem natürlichen Labor derzeitiger eHealth-Implementationsintiviativen in der EU und darüber hinaus eine evidenzbasierte Antwort auf dieses Problem zu geben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Forschung des Projektes baut dabei auf vorhergegangenen internationalen Projekten auf (z.B. &lt;a href=&#34;https://renewinghealth.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Renewing Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.e-compared.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;E-COMPARED&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastermind-project.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MasterMind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.implementall.eu/16-npt.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NPT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.implementall.eu/17-nomad.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NoMAD&lt;/a&gt;, und &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.implementall.eu/18-mast.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die laufenden Implementations-Initiativen, die die Basis für die Implementationforschung dieses Projektes bilden, basieren sämtlich auf internet-basierter kognitiver Verhaltenstherapie (iCBT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICBT-Implementationsprozesse werden derzeit auf der ganzen Welt durchgeführt. ImpleMentAll nutzt diese Projekte, um Werkzeuge zur Implementation von iCBT zu entwerfen, die eHealth effizienter machen sollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ziele-des-projekts&#34;&gt;Ziele des Projekts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entwicklung eines generischen &amp;ldquo;Integrated Theory&amp;rdquo;-basierten Rahmens für Interventions-Anpassungen (ItFits-toolkit) zur datenbasierten Implementation evidenzbasierter eHealth-Dienstleistungen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstration der Vorteile des ItFits-toolkit auf die Implementation von eHealth für psychische Störungen (iCBT) in 9 europäischen Ländern und Australien&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissemination des validierten Toolkits in verschiedenen Kontexten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet-based intervention for major depression in diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 with smartphone support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30% of all diabetes patients suffer from major depression or subclinical depressive symptoms. Meta-analyses prove the effectiveness of internet-based health interventions (IGI) in the area of depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a randomized controlled trial, participants with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and depressive symptoms (N=352) are assigned to a six-week diabetes-specific Internet-based program for managing depressive symptoms or to a control group (psychoeducation) with unrestricted access to routine care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily text messages and weekly individual feedback by e-mail are intended to increase the adherence of the training. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive symptoms. Secondary endpoints include diabetic-specific emotional stress and glycaemic control (HbA1c).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be assessed after the intervention and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online training for the management of panic disorders with smartphone support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet-based interventions (IBI) to reduce panic and fear have proven to be effective. So far, however, these online programs have not supported the person concerned in practicing new behavioral patterns directly in the fear-inducing situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose we developed GET.ON Panic - an online training based on cognitive behavioral therapy consisting of 6 lessons on psychoeducation, exposure, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training has been expanded with elements for the smartphone, such as a diary or exposure app. In a 2-arm randomized controlled study, the effects of GET.ON Panic are compared with those of a waiting control group. Participants with subclinical and clinical panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GET.ON Panic is a promising IBI, which, thanks to smartphone support, starts &amp;ldquo;where the panic happens&amp;rdquo; - namely in the everyday life of those affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online regeneration training for better sleep for teachers with high occupational demands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders and work-related stress often occur together and are associated with individual suffering and functional limitations as well as high economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapeutic interventions for insomnia (IKVT-I) have the potential to reduce the existing gap in care and have proven to be effective in many cases. Less is known about the effectiveness of IKVT-I in populations with work-related stress.  Therefore, the aim is to evaluate an IKVT-I training specifically designed for work-related stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a two-armed, randomized controlled study (N = 126) the effects of IKVT-I training (GET.ON Regeneration) are compared to a waiting control condition before, after training and to a 6-month catamnesis. Teachers with clinically significant insomniac complaints and work-related stress reactions are included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GET.ON Regeneration emphasizes, in addition to classic KVT-I elements (e.g. sleep restriction, examination of dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions), the mental distancing from occupational problems and the promotion of recovery activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A health economic evaluation from a societal perspective is carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occupational stress is associated with numerous psychological and emotional problems, such as depression and anxiety, and can have a significant economic cost due to loss of productivity, absenteeism or incapacity to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies prove the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face training; however, it is costly and time-consuming. Online-based interventions to reduce occupational stress counteract these disadvantages, but there is little evidence to date. Persons from the general population who experience occupational stress (N=260) are randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the 6-month waiting list control group in a randomized controlled trial. Participants will receive weekly feedback from an online coach on each of the 7 training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficacy will be assessed at pre- and post-trial, after 6 months, and as an extended follow-up for the IG after 12 months. Primary outcome is perceived stress. Cost effectiveness is also reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
