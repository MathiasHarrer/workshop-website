With the aim of improving psychotherapeutic care, the project implements and evaluates a new form of treatment, so-called blended therapy, which is a combination of online-based treatment components and outpatient psychotherapy sessions. Blended therapy has the potential to improve psychotherapeutic care, as the combination of outpatient psychotherapy with online-based treatment components enables a more flexible way of delivering therapy. Other advantages are an improved transfer of therapy content into the everyday life of the patients and an increase in the capacities of psychotherapists.\nWithin the PSYCHOnlineTHERAPY project, blended psychotherapy will be evaluated in two variants and compared to standard routine care psychotherapy in a three-armed cluster-randomized controlled non-inferiority study. Psychotherapy sessions in all three study conditions comprise cognitive behavioral therapy with outpatient psychotherapists. The two variants of blended psychotherapy differ in the flexibility of the sequence and amount of psychotherapy sessions and online-based treatment components that patients additionally complete between therapy sessions. Therapists can assign the online-based treatment components individually according to the needs of their patients.\nThe scientific evaluation of the project includes both quantitative and qualitative assessments at multiple times of measurement. The two variants of blended psychotherapy are evaluated for their effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility.\nFunding Innovationsfonds des Gemeinsamen Bundesausschusses zu

Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathias Harrer, MSc"],"categories":null,"content":"Recent decades have seen an unprecedented increase in the amount of research articles published each year. Evidence in the form of scientific publications has been increasing almost exponentially, with petabytes of research findings produced on a daily basis. In biomedicine alone, more than one million peer-reviewed articles are published each year.\nIn a recent viewpoint published in BMJ Evidence-based Mental Health↗, Cuijpers and colleagues argue that meta-analysis, a common statistical method to synthesize the results of multiple studies, requires an upgrade to keep pace with the breakneck speed of scientific production in the 21st century. They propose the concept of a meta-analytic research domain (MARDs).\n MARDs are living databases of an entire research domain, which are curated in a way that allows for fast, comprehensive and high-quality evidence synthesis. In contrast to conventional systematic reviews and meta-analyses, MARDs do not focus on one specific population, intervention, comparison, or outcome (PICO), but on an entire research field that is too broad to be covered by one meta-analysis.\n While MARDs are resource-intensive and take time to implement, they come with considerable advantages:\n  Reduction of research waste. In the biomedical field, a great amount of redundant, misleading, and biased research is produced on a regular basis (MacLeod et al., 2014). This is also the case in psychotherapy research (Cristea \u0026amp; Naudet, 2019). By centralizing all available evidence, unnecessary work can be avoided. Transparent and consistent standards can lead to more trustworthy findings.\n  Evidence Mapping. MARDs provide an overview of limitations and gaps in knowledge and make it possible to see emerging trends in the field.\n  Meta-Research (“Research on Research”). MARDs allow examining the methods and research practices of an entire field, and how they changed over time.\n  Stakeholders outside the scientific community. MARDs can enable just-in-time evidence generation for specific research questions. This can be used by e.g. treatment guideline developers or clinicians, to get an overview of the current evidence.\n  Open Science. MARDs provide data in a transparent, accessible, and interoperable way. This allows other members of the scientific community to re-use or repurpose the provided information.\n     Core features of a meta-analytic research domain (MARD).\nMetapsy: A Centralized Hub of MARDs on Psychological Interventions for Mental Disorders One example of a research project developing MARDs is Metapsy↗. The goal of this project is to provide access to meta-analytic databases of clinical trials investigating the effect of psychological interventions (e.g. psychotherapy, preventive interventions, psychoeducation) on various mental disorders or mental health problems.\nMetapsy creates a unified framework for all available meta-analytic data across different indications and settings. All databases are (1) created by university-based research teams using state-of-the-art methodology; (2) updated regularly, at least once each year; (3) formatted using an identical and transparent coding scheme; (4) receive extensive documentation and metadata, including versioning and persistent data identifiers (DOIs), following the FAIR principles; and (5) are made publicly available via data repositories.\nResearchers can also easily access the databases using the designated R package metapsyData, and data can be analyzed using state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods; either using the metapsyTools R package or using an Online Meta-Analysis Tool.\nMore information can be found on the Metapsy website↗.\nReferences Cristea, I.

The disorder can affect emotional, physical, social as well as academic development. It\u0026rsquo;s consequences can, especially for children, adolescents, and young adults, extend into adulthood. The elevated distress, the possible psychological implications, educational difficulties as well as possible long-term suffering within the disorder can result in a high burden on an individual as well as on a societal level.\nAlthough there are effective treatments for PTSD in adolescents and young adults, not every person affected receives treatment offering due to structural as well as attitudinal barriers. Internet- and mobile-based interventions can help fill this health care gap. But they do not yet exist for adolescents and young adults so far.\nThe project StAR aims to fill this research- as well as the health care gap, in developing an internet- and mobile-based Intervention for adolescents and young adults with PTSD and evaluating it in a feasibility study. A subsequent randomized controlled trial aims at determining its efficacy.\nStAR is a subproject in the research association BestForCan. BestForCan aims at disseminating a special psychotherapeutic intervention for children, adolescents, and young adults after child abuse and neglect.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation

prevalence and higher occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and can lead to reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, individuals with both CBP and recurrent MDD are underidentified. Utilizing health care insurance data may provide a possibility to better identify this complex population. In addition, internet- and mobile-based interventions might enhance the availability of existing treatments and provide help to those highly burdened individuals.\nObjective: This pilot randomized controlled trial investigated the feasibility of recruitment via the health records of a German health insurance company. The study also examined user satisfaction and effectiveness of a 9-week cognitive behavioral therapy and Web- and mobile-based guided self-help intervention Get.Back in CBP patients with recurrent MDD on sick leave compared with a waitlist control condition.\nMethods: Health records from a German health insurance company were used to identify and recruit participants (N=76) via invitation letters. Study outcomes were measured using Web-based self-report assessments at baseline, posttreatment (9 weeks), and a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression); secondary outcomes included anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life), pain-related variables (Oswestry Disability Index, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and pain intensity), and negative effects (Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy).\nResults: The total enrollment rate with the recruitment strategy used was 1.26% (76/6000). Participants completed 4.8 modules (SD 2.6, range 0-7) of Get.Back. The overall user satisfaction was favorable (mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire score=24.5, SD 5.2). Covariance analyses showed a small but statistically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity in the intervention group (n=40) at posttreatment compared with the waitlist control group (n=36; F1,76=3.62, P=.03; d=0.28, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.74). Similar findings were noted for the reduction of anxiety symptoms (F1,76=10.45; P=.001; d=0.14, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.60) at posttreatment. Other secondary outcomes were nonsignificant (.06≤P≤.44). At the 6-month follow-up, the difference between the groups with regard to reduction in depressive symptom severity was no longer statistically significant (F1,76=1.50, P=.11; d=0.10, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.46). The between-group difference in anxiety at posttreatment was maintained to follow-up (F1,76=2.94, P=.04; d=0.38, 95% CI −0.07 to 0.83). There were no statistically significant differences across groups regarding other secondary outcomes at the 6-month follow-up (.08≤P≤.42).\nConclusions: These results suggest that participants with comorbid depression and CBP on sick leave may benefit from internet- and mobile-based interventions, as exemplified with the positive user satisfaction ratings. The recruitment strategy via health insurance letter invitations appeared feasible, but more research is needed to understand how response rates in untreated individuals with CBP and comorbid depression can be increased.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"735b1c1184cc4ba0a5c4feb2ba49652d","permalink":"/en/publication/a-web-and-mobile-based-intervention-for-comorbid-recurrent-depression-in-patients-with-chronic-back-pain-on-sick-leave-get-back-pilot-randomized-controlled-trial-on-/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/a-web-and-mobile-based-intervention-for-comorbid-recurrent-depression-in-patients-with-chronic-back-pain-on-sick-leave-get-back-pilot-randomized-controlled-trial-on-/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract\nBackground: Chronic back pain (CBP) is linked to a higher prevalence and higher occurrence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and can lead to reduced quality of life.

In principle, apps could be a low-threshold, anonymous, time- and location-independent and cost-effective supplement to traditional mental health treatment options, but their effectiveness is still largely unclear.\nIn a recently published systematic review, Kiona Weisel et al. examined the effectiveness of smartphone apps as a stand-alone treatment for mental health. The meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials that examined apps for the treatment of adults with increased symptoms of mental disorder compared to a control group. A total of 19 studies with 3681 participants were found with apps to improve depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol consumption, smoking, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorder and self-harming thoughts and behaviors.\nThe results showed that smartphone apps had only small effects on depression and smoking behavior, whereas there were no effects on anxiety, self-harming thoughts and behaviors and alcohol consumption. Individual studies with apps for post-traumatic stress disorder were also not effective, while large effects were found in two individual studies on sleep problems.\nApps have enormous potential, but the current study situation is sobering. The approach must be fundamentally distinguished from web-based treatment formats for mental illness, for which numerous studies show that they can have great effects on a wide range of mental illnesses, many of which are even comparable with those of conventional health care services such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy.\nThe conclusion: Smartphone apps cannot be recommended as a stand-alone treatment for mental disorders on the basis of the current evidence.

There is currently no laboratory test for this disorder, so patients often have to wait years for a diagnosis. During this time, they do not receive the treatment and support they need. For this reason, we are developing a molecular test based on \u0026ldquo;Blood Spots\u0026rdquo; (i.e. dried drops of blood on filter paper). Such a test can provide an early and accurate diagnosis for patients with depression and help to get further assistance quickly. We measure the concentration of over 100 proteins in the dried blood drops. To do this, we use a technique called mass spectrometer analysis. The results of the study will be published. ​\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation    ","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649770377,"objectID":"fd92f23107feed6749a56d4c4346767b","permalink":"/en/project/dried-blood-spots/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/dried-blood-spots/","section":"project","summary":"Identification of Depression Biomarkers","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Dried Blood Spots","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ingrid Titzler, MSc, DiplKommWirt, PP"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Depression is one of the most common and serious diseases of our time. Currently, about four million people in Germany suffer from the symptoms, but only a few receive effective treatment.\nInternet-based forms of treatment can be a possible supplement to classic therapy concepts. These promise a lower uptake threshold, reduced waiting times and help independent of time and place. Numerous studies show that these forms of treatment can be successful in depression. However, not all patients are interested in and/or suitable for a purely internet-supported treatment. Combined procedures that combine psychotherapy on site and internet-supported treatment elements could use the advantages of both approaches and be a promising supplement to classic forms of therapy.\nAgainst this background, the Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU is investigating the effectiveness of such a combined depression treatment (online lessons on website, smartphone app, personal therapy conversations on site in Erlangen).\nRecruitment in general practitioners' practices within the RCT study took place from February 2015 to August 2016. We are currently not enrolling any more patients in the study. The treatment phase of \u0026ldquo;Moodbuster\u0026rdquo; will be completed in early 2017 for the last patient enrolled.\n Scientific background E-COMPARED (European-COMPARative Effectiveness research on online depression) is an interdisciplinary project involving specialists from the fields of psychology, health technology, communication and information technology and health care. The original project period from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2016 has been extended by another 6 months until 30.06.2017. The project compares the standard treatment of depression in eight European countries with a combination of personal (face-to-face) and web- or mobile-based therapy.\nThe evaluation will use randomized controlled trials (RCT), advanced ICT (information and communication technology) platforms, technological intelligence and an economic prediction model to investigate which form of treatment is more effective, for which patient group and under which conditions. In Germany, the evaluation study was implemented in primary health care and thus in the setting of the outpatient treatment of depressive patients in GP practice. For this purpose, close cooperation with GP practices in the Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth metropolitan region took place.\n Cooperating GP practices in the metropolitan region Erlangen-Nuremberg-Fürth We would like to thank the GP practices who, as cooperation partners, have been able to support the study and win over their affected patients to participate in the study on the treatment of depressive symptoms. Flyers and posters for the waiting room and the personal doctor-patient consultation were made available to the GPs for the recruitment of patients in the GP practices. The time spent by the general practitioners involved in the study was to be a maximum of 30-60 minutes per patient and was compensated. By participating in the study, family doctors' practices are making an important contribution to the further development of depression treatment in Germany. In addition, their patients benefited from a prompt start of treatment; i.e. therapy places were available without waiting time. An overview of the cooperating GP practices can be found here.\n The research project for depressive patients in family practice Patients affected by depressive symptoms could contact their own family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice, as any family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice could start a cooperation with us at any time. By answering a health questionnaire (by post or online) patients registered with us and subsequently received further information.\n Conditions of participation Patients who were at least 18 years old and were not undergoing any current psychotherapeutic treatment by psychologists or doctors were eligible to participate in the study. Previous therapeutic experience or an existing or concurrent drug treatment was allowed. Another prerequisite for participation was the diagnosis of major depression (mild, moderate or severe; also chronic courses or relapses). Patients with the diagnosis of a minor depression were referred to a depression prevention study by us. The diagnosis was carried out by our test directors (telephone interview).\nIn order to participate in our study, the treating family doctor\u0026rsquo;s practice had to already be a cooperation partner of ours or show willingness to become one. In order to participate in the internet-supported therapy modules, a computer with internet access was necessary.\nThe project was awarded the Erlanger Medizinpreis in 2017.\n Funding European Union\n   ","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"417cc6fdc038f6b70ef9c1383291d5b7","permalink":"/en/project/e-compared/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/e-compared/","section":"project","summary":"Blended Psychotherapy, combination of Internet-, App- and face-to-face psychotherapy","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"E-Compared","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sandra Schlicker, DiplPsych, PP"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Effectiveness of a guided web-based intervention for the treatment of depression and back pain during incapacity to work.\nBack pain and depression are among the number one common diseases and are enormously stressful for those affected. Depression usually affects all areas of the patient\u0026rsquo;s life: thinking, feelings, actions, body and relationships with other people. And because it is precisely with this disease that it is so difficult to make the decision to seek help, even though the drive to change something is lacking, it is extremely important to take a new path.\nThat is why an online training has been developed for people who have back pain, suffer from depressive symptoms, are currently on sick leave, and want to work on improving their mood. The following questions will be examined:\n Is Get.Back effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment? Is Get.Back cost effective for back pain patients with depression compared to standard treatment? Which factors moderate the effect of Get.Back?  Based on a two-arm, pragmatic, randomized controlled study, Get.Back aims to investigate a web-based depression intervention. Get.Back includes modules for behavioral activation, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, physical activation and relapse prevention. The program is developed for weekly treatment over a total period of nine weeks and includes stwo booster sessions two and four months after the end of treatment.\nPrimary study outcome is depression severity at end of intervention. Secondary outcomes are: Depression remission, quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related limitation, pain-related self-efficacy, work capacity, adherence and satisfaction with the intervention, and intervention costs.\nOutlook: The present effectiveness study focuses on disability due to back pain and depression as the most common health conditions associated with high life expectancy and health care costs.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER\n   ","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"a4c4808efee5739074915cbddec16fef","permalink":"/en/project/get-back/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/get-back/","section":"project","summary":"eHealth for depression, back pain and sick leave","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"Get.Back","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Anna-Carlotta Zarski","Kiona Weisel, MSc","Marvin Franke, MSc"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Mental stress is not uncommon. Many people suffer from low spirits, worries, fears, or feel a general sense of dissatisfaction.\nThe 7-week online training ICare Prevent provides help in dealing with such feelings and offers background information on how they arise. In addition, the training aims to improve mental well-being and reduce mental discomfort through systematic training of helpful and proven strategies such as problem solving and activity planning to strengthen important areas of everyday life.\nThe online training ICare Prevent is currently being evaluated in a multicenter study in cooperation with universities in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain and Austria.\nICare Prevent is part of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 program, which has set itself the goal of developing, implementing and evaluating online training for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in order to improve existing care structures, open new access routes and overcome implementation barriers.\n Project Coordination Under the direction of Dr. David Ebert, Prof. Dr. Thomas Berger and PD Dr. Michael Schaub, one focus of our research at the Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy (KliPs) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and at the Universities of Bern and Zurich is the development and scientific investigation of online programs in various areas, such as depression, anxiety disorders, stress management, sleep disorders, alcohol abuse and procrastination.\n Promotion \u0026amp; Cooperation ICare Prevent is a cooperation project within the framework of the ICare - Integrating Technology into Mental Health Care Delivery in Europe project. ICare Prevent received funding within the Horizon2020 research and innovation program of the European Union (Grant agreement No 634757).\nThe ICare project aims to establish an innovative, comprehensive mental health care delivery model in Europe. It combines evidence-based prevention, early detection and treatment of common mental disorders via a common online platform. In cooperation with established health care providers, ICare will complement or be integrated into existing services in order to avoid and reduce long-term costs caused by mental illness.\nThe project partners come from a total of six European countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Great Britain, Netherlands, Spain). All project partners have many years of research experience in the field of e-mental health. Together they can present a portfolio of more than 30 evidence-based online programmes for the promotion of mental health and for prevention, self-help, treatment and aftercare of mental illness.\nFurther information can be found here.\n\n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"e7a1a088dfb0c0fbb27f227f5366b8cd","permalink":"/en/project/icare-prevent/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/icare-prevent/","section":"project","summary":"Internet and mobile-based prevention of depression and anxiety disorders","tags":["Laufend"],"title":"ICare Prevent","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ingrid Titzler, MSc, DiplKommWirt, PP","Janika Thielecke, MSc","Prof. Dr. Claudia Buntrock","Johanna Freund, MSc"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Mental disorder prevention with Internet- and telephone-based interventions for persons in the \u0026ldquo;green professions \u0026ldquo;\nThe model project \u0026ldquo;Mit uns im Gleichgewicht\u0026rdquo; (In Balance With Us), funded by the Social Insurance for Agriculture, Forestry and Horticulture (SVLFG), aims to promote and maintain mental health among farmers, foresters and horticulturists and is being scientifically evaluated by the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg and the University of Ulm.\nIn order to maintain and promote the mental health of farmers, foresters and horticulturists, the SVLFG offers the insured persons on-site preventive measures such as seminars on stress management. Within the framework of the model project, these offers will be expanded to include internet and tele-based interventions (online health training by the GET.ON Institute and intensive individual coaching by IVPNetworks). Interventions to prevent mental stress are particularly in demand in agriculture, as this occupational group is exposed to many stressors and strains due to difficult working conditions (e.g. high workload, family conflicts, seasonal work). It has been proven that internet and tele-based interventions can be effective, but the effects at population level depend on the actual use of the target group. With this background, there is a great need for scientifically sound knowledge about the needs of farmers, foresters and horticulturists, their partners and family members working with them, and how these needs can be met effectively. In addition, it should be examined whether target group-specific offers for this group of people can effectively and cost-effectively counteract the development of depressive disorders.\nThe Chair of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the FAU, on behalf of SVLFG, is investigating in partly overlapping sub-projects the current use and acceptance of preventive interventions among farmers, gardeners and foresters on the one hand, and the effectiveness of two specific interventions (online-based health training, telemedical intensive care) on the other hand.

Problematic Internet usage can relate to computer games, social networks, but also to online sex, online shopping and online gambling. Where is the line between everyday use and problematic use? Problematic behavior begins when affected persons have an irresistible desire for the respective activities. Their thoughts and emotions are massively influenced by online offers.\nPeople who use the Internet excessively begin to lose control over their use and, if they are denied access, withdrawal symptoms may occur. This can manifest itself, for example, in restlessness, nervousness or depressive mood. Tolerance can also develop and other important areas of life can be affected. Problematic Internet use thus has negative consequences in various areas.

MSc"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Mental Health Promotion in College Students StudiCare includes various online training courses for the prevention and treatment of mental illness, tailored to the needs of college students. In order to improve existing offers, the StudiCare panel regularly surveys undergraduate students at the Friedrich-Alexander-University and the University of Ulm about their mental well-being from the first semester onwards.\nBackground College is a new stage of life in which students make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. This transition period is characterized by joyful experiences as well as new, stressful situations. These include, for example, looking for one\u0026rsquo;s own apartment, organizing finances and studies, finding new friends, getting used to a new environment, exam stress, etc. In the course of their studies, students are not only confronted with this new situation, but may also experience crises. In combination with possible risk behaviors, such as excessive consumption of alcohol or cannabis, this can lead to exhaustion, psychosomatic complaints, anxiety and depressive disorders.\nStudiCare Panel The web-based panel survey is conducted in numerous countries worldwide as part of the WHO The World Mental Health Survey Initiative under the coordination of Harvard University among students from the first semester onwards. The aim of the survey is to obtain information on the mental health of students as well as on risk and protective factors for emotional stress during their undergraduate studies. In addition, more information on the willingness and barriers to using psychosocial interventions and counseling services will be collected. With information from the surveys, the need for help and support services will be assessed, existing counseling services will be improved and new online-based interventions tailored to the individual needs of students will be developed.\nStudiCare Online Health Trainings The online health training courses from StudiCare are low-threshold structured self-help training courses. These trainings can improve the well-being of students and alleviate complaints in a wide variety of areas. They can be used independently of time and place, can be optimally integrated into the individual daily routine and can be conducted anonymously. In the training courses, students manage their complaints independently by working through numerous modules. Modules are based on cognitive-behavioral techniques that are also used in conventional psychotherapy. Essential here are various practical exercises such as relaxation techniques, protocols for self-observation and the integration of small exercises into everyday life (\u0026ldquo;tiny task\u0026rdquo;). These help to reduce negative behavior and build up positive behavior. In the course of the project, new trainings are continuously being developed that deal with topics that are relevant for students. The newly developed online health trainings will be examined in randomized clinical studies to evaluate their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.\nTraining Participation\nEvidence-based methods for promoting mental health among students: Series of meta-analytical reviews In order to derive appropriate measures, a comprehensive assessment of the current evidence base of psychosocial support services is necessary. In a series of meta-analytical reviews, the current knowledge about effective psychological treatment and prevention services including their effectiveness is collected and critically examined. Psychological interventions and their effectiveness are examined with regard to specific disorder areas (e.g. anxiety symptoms, eating disorders, sleep disorders, suicidal tendencies) or intervention methods (e.g. internet-based procedures, \u0026ldquo;third wave\u0026rdquo; procedures). Along with clinical effectiveness, special attention is devoted to the influence of interventions on the academic impairment of students.\n Promotion \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER, Bergische

Patients, according to Eysenck, are often better off after some time had passed, even without treatment -psychotherapy is thus ascribed a healing effect that is not caused by it. In short, Eysenck\u0026rsquo;s assessment was that psychotherapy is ineffective, even preventing improvement in some cases.\n Psychotherapy is generally considered an effective procedure The development of the randomized controlled trial, which compares treated patients with an untreated control group, and meta-analysis, in which many studies are mathematically summarized, attempted to address Eysencks allegation. Since then, on the basis of such methods, there has been a perceived certainty that psychotherapy, in contrast to Eysenck\u0026rsquo;s allegation, is indeed effective, as a very large decrease in, for example, depressive symptoms has been found in treated versus untreated groups.\n Was Eysenck right after all? A recent paper by Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Reijnders and Ebert (2018) curbs this enthusiasm about meta-analytic findings on the effectiveness of psychotherapy for depression and addresses the question of whether Eysenck might have been right. In particular, the authors argue that much of the evidence on the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression is distorted by so-called bias, that is systematic errors or artifacts in randomized controlled trials that make the effectiveness of psychotherapy shine in a much brighter light than is actually the case.\nBias can be caused by many factors. When new drugs are developed and evaluated, they are usually compared to a so-called placebo: Patients do not know if they are given a pill with or without an active ingredient. Often, a placebo effect is also found: simply by the fact that patients believe they take an effective drug improves their symptoms, even if it is a sugar pill with no active ingredient.\nThis placebo effect is also of particular importance for psychotherapy research: Patients in psychotherapy studies know exactly whether they are receiving the therapeutic treatment studied or if they are in the control condition. Because patients in the treatment condition expect an effective treatment, this placebo effect alone could improve their symptoms without the treatment itself being significant. On the other hand, patients in the control group know that they are not expected to see any real improvement, which has a negative effect on the alleviation of their symptoms, as these patients often do not change their behavior until they receive treatment after the study has ended. This is just one of many types of bias that might cause psychotherapy to be considered much more effective than it actually is.\n Findings The study by Cuijpers and colleagues therefore attempted to analyze how the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression decreases when controlling for all types of bias. It turned out that for all types of psychotherapy the overall effects decreased heavily. The effectiveness of therapies for depression was overestimated for a long time. It turned out, however, that despite the control of all possible systematic errors, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) still yielded positive results. For psychodynamic procedures, this was not the case, although not even all forms of bias could be controlled for. For other procedures, such as interpersonal therapy, there have been too few studies to make accurate statements.\nThis analysis shows that Eysenck\u0026rsquo;s verdict must be taken very seriously, albeit being probably incorrect for very well empirically grounded procedures. More accuracy and more precise research methods are needed to truly ensure the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic approaches.\n","date":1541894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"d9cd122fe13bb18a382370c53b02cd6d","permalink":"/en/post/eysenck/","publishdate":"2018-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/eysenck/","section":"post","summary":"About 65 years ago, German-British psychologist Hans-Jürgen Eysenck (1916-1997) caused a great stir with a paper in which he questioned the effectiveness of psychotherapy.

Description Internet-based intervention for major depression in diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 with smartphone support\nAbout 30% of all diabetes patients suffer from major depression or subclinical depressive symptoms. Meta-analyses prove the effectiveness of internet-based health interventions (IGI) in the area of depressive disorders.\nIn a randomized controlled trial, participants with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and depressive symptoms (N=352) are assigned to a six-week diabetes-specific Internet-based program for managing depressive symptoms or to a control group (psychoeducation) with unrestricted access to routine care.\nDaily text messages and weekly individual feedback by e-mail are intended to increase the adherence of the training. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive symptoms. Secondary endpoints include diabetic-specific emotional stress and glycaemic control (HbA1c).\nProgram effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be assessed after the intervention and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER\n   ","date":1455494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"8fd2fc1a5f430349ff4af2accffeeda6","permalink":"/en/project/geton-diabetes/","publishdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/geton-diabetes/","section":"project","summary":"Supportive Intervention for Depression and Diabetes","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"Get.On Diabetes","type":"project"},{"authors":["Prof. Dr. Claudia Buntrock"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Internet-based prevention of major depression\nMajor Depression (MD) is associated with a significant loss of quality of life, increased mortality rates and enormous economic costs. It is estimated that current therapies could reduce the burden of disease attributable to MD at the population level by only one third.\nPreventive services can help reduce the burden of disease caused by MD. The aim of the study is therefore to evaluate an internet-based intervention for the prevention of MD.\nMethods: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial (N=420) the (cost-) effectiveness of an internet-based intervention (GET.ON Depression) relative to a control condition (psychoeducation) will be compared to the 12-month catamnesis. The sample includes adults with subclinical depression. GET.ON Depression includes minimal therapeutic support by an online coach.

So far, however, these online programs have not supported the person concerned in practicing new behavioral patterns directly in the fear-inducing situation.\nFor this purpose we developed GET.ON Panic - an online training based on cognitive behavioral therapy consisting of 6 lessons on psychoeducation, exposure, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention.\nThe training has been expanded with elements for the smartphone, such as a diary or exposure app. In a 2-arm randomized controlled study, the effects of GET.ON Panic are compared with those of a waiting control group. Participants with subclinical and clinical panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) are included.\nGET.ON Panic is a promising IBI, which, thanks to smartphone support, starts \u0026ldquo;where the panic happens\u0026rdquo; - namely in the everyday life of those affected.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER\n   ","date":1455494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"6195d5c6a26986482a46784fe93e1f16","permalink":"/en/project/geton-panic/","publishdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/geton-panic/","section":"project","summary":"Internet- und Smartphone-based Treatment of Panic Disorder","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"Get.On Panic","type":"project"},{"authors":["Prof. Dr. David Daniel Ebert"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Online regeneration training for better sleep for teachers with high occupational demands\nSleep disorders and work-related stress often occur together and are associated with individual suffering and functional limitations as well as high economic costs.\nInternet-based cognitive-behavioural therapeutic interventions for insomnia (IKVT-I) have the potential to reduce the existing gap in care and have proven to be effective in many cases. Less is known about the effectiveness of IKVT-I in populations with work-related stress. Therefore, the aim is to evaluate an IKVT-I training specifically designed for work-related stress.\nIn a two-armed, randomized controlled study (N = 126) the effects of IKVT-I training (GET.ON Regeneration) are compared to a waiting control condition before, after training and to a 6-month catamnesis. Teachers with clinically significant insomniac complaints and work-related stress reactions are included in the study.\nGET.ON Regeneration emphasizes, in addition to classic KVT-I elements (e.g. sleep restriction, examination of dysfunctional sleep-related cognitions), the mental distancing from occupational problems and the promotion of recovery activities.\nA health economic evaluation from a societal perspective is carried out.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER\n   ","date":1455494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"b3a02d010b5185f3471f042a1aea866b","permalink":"/en/project/geton-regeneration/","publishdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/geton-regeneration/","section":"project","summary":"Technology-based Sleep Training","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"Get.On Regeneration","type":"project"},{"authors":["Prof. Dr. David Daniel Ebert"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description Occupational stress is associated with numerous psychological and emotional problems, such as depression and anxiety, and can have a significant economic cost due to loss of productivity, absenteeism or incapacity to work.\nNumerous studies prove the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face training; however, it is costly and time-consuming. Online-based interventions to reduce occupational stress counteract these disadvantages, but there is little evidence to date. Persons from the general population who experience occupational stress (N=260) are randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the 6-month waiting list control group in a randomized controlled trial. Participants will receive weekly feedback from an online coach on each of the 7 training sessions.\nEfficacy will be assessed at pre- and post-trial, after 6 months, and as an extended follow-up for the IG after 12 months. Primary outcome is perceived stress. Cost effectiveness is also reviewed.\n ​\nFunding \u0026amp; Cooperation BARMER\n   ","date":1455494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"25c56df04666d00394ab30dc93ff4abd","permalink":"/en/project/geton-stress/","publishdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/geton-stress/","section":"project","summary":"Internet- und App-based Stress Management","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"Get.On Stress","type":"project"},{"authors":["Anne Etzelmüller, DiplPsych, PP","Ingrid Titzler, MSc, DiplKommWirt, PP"],"categories":null,"content":" Project Description The MasterMind project aimed to make high-quality treatment methods for depression more widely available in Europe using internet and technology-based concepts.\nDepression targets a huge disease burden worldwide, which manifests itself in high incidence rates and enormous social costs. Technology-based treatment concepts are well researched and show high efficacy in the treatment of depression.\nThe aim of the project was to evaluate the effectiveness of cCBT (computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy) in more than 10 EU countries within a large-scale project (more than 5,000 patients).\nThe project identified barriers and success factors in the implementation of cCBT in different political, social, and economic contexts, and from the perspective of patients, professionals, and health care providers. On this basis, recommendations were made for the implementation of cCBT at the European level.\nThe project ran from 1 March 2014 to 28 February 2017.\nPublications \u0026amp; Deliverables\n Topics of the Project Equal access to treatment: All EU citizens suffering from depression should have equal access to evidence-based treatment.\nCollaboration: Countries and regions within the EU cooperate to exchange knowledge and optimise treatment processes.\nInclusion: Health professionals, healthcare providers, and patients are equally involved in the development of good treatment options.\nSelf-management: All patients with depression who are willing and able to do so should be given the chance to manage their mental health themselves with technical support.\n Funding \u0026amp; Cooperation    ","date":1455494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"ba64f7158580923b4d185544a10854fe","permalink":"/en/project/mastermind/","publishdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/mastermind/","section":"project","summary":"Pilot Project for the Implementation of eHealth in Europe","tags":["Abgeschlossen"],"title":"MasterMind","type":"project"},{"authors":["Dr. Anna-Carlotta Zarski","D Lehr","M Berking","H Riper","P Cuijpers","Prof. Dr. David Daniel Ebert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"4067b6290f466536e0fe22d63659a711","permalink":"/en/publication/adherence-to-internet-based-mobile-supported-stress-management-a-pooled-analysis-of-individual-participant-data-from-three-randomized-controlled-trials/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/adherence-to-internet-based-mobile-supported-stress-management-a-pooled-analysis-of-individual-participant-data-from-three-randomized-controlled-trials/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Adherence to internet-based mobile-supported stress management- a pooled analysis of individual participant data from three randomized controlled trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Anna-Carlotta Zarski","C Rosenau","C Fackiner","M Berking","Prof. Dr. David Daniel Ebert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633074569,"objectID":"42da14aa9f012b5f0e48ac78fedffd62","permalink":"/en/publication/an-internet-based-guided-self-help-intervention-for-vaginismus-results-of-a-randomised-controlled-proof-of-concept-trial/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/an-internet-based-guided-self-help-intervention-for-vaginismus-results-of-a-randomised-controlled-proof-of-concept-trial/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An internet-based guided self-help intervention for vaginismus.
